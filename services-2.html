				<p>AND THEY SAY</p>
				<!-- short ver -->
				<p>What sets JJ apart in an entirely different (and better) category is how smart, helpful, and humble he is. He took the time to understand our business and technology better than anyone else, and thus were able to add more value. He also is a thought leader – and leaders in general – not looking to others for social proof – he is bold enough and smart enough to be strong and supportive. Finally, and on top of all of that, he shares my goal of making the world a better place, and I very much look forward to doing just that with him.<br>
					— Founder, 100+ startups</p>
				<p>We are incredibly excited to partner with JJ because of how impressed we quickly became by the experience, work ethic, and service mindset. We're strong believers in his ability to execute and add value, and we are looking forward to working together to improve the lives of billions across the world.<br>
					— Founder, series B manufactureing tech startup</p>
				<p>He did all this? I like what I'm seeing.<br>
					— Former Prime Minister, Largest 10 Country</p>
				<p>I like his stuff. We'll make amazing things together.<br>
					— Investor, growth stage VC</p>
				<p>I just love everything he touches.<br>
					— Investor, early stage VC</p>
				<p>This is just amazing. I cannot express how much I love the design.<br>
					— Investor, Seed fund</p>
				<p>Cool! Very cool indeed! I can now see the future! This is going to be a total industry game changer.<br>
					— Director of Engineering, Biggest 5 Oil & Gas company</p>
				<p>A truly invaluable partner, he is a superhero trouble shooter and offer untold amounts of strategic insight, support, and engagement. We have built numerous companies and have never had such a thoughtful, connected, and invested partner.<br>
					— Founder, multiple biotech startup exits</p>
				<p>He is so great at capturing people's hearts.<br>
					— Investor, early stage VC</p>
				<p>I am always impressed with his glyphs.<br>
					— Director, National Science Lab</p>
				<p>I’m psyched. Can’t wait. It’s gonna be epic.<br>
					— Founder, unicorn govtech</p>
				<p>This is an amazing software platform to handle single-cell phenotypes. I haven’t seen anything else on the market like it.<br>
					— Head of Imaging, Big Pharma</p>
				<p>I now have the ability to actually understand the underlying biology from the AI results. It means that I can trust the data, but more importantly, I can explain to others why it matters and is so important! There is not a single tool on the market like this – the potential experiments that I can run with something like this just exploded!<br>
					— Bio Research Director, Top 5 University Research Lab</p>
				<p>Affordable homes, good paying jobs, reliable mass transit, and an overarching view of resiliency and sustainability — that's what the product allows us to track.<br>
					— Mayor, Biggest 50 US city</p>
				<p>The design looks rad. The total package. Perfect.<br>
					— Investor, growth stage VC</p>
				<p>We are always thinking about JJ for our portfolio companies. I seriously do wish we had a spot open here at the firm for JJ right now. Nevertheless I'm determined to rope him into our family as close to us as we can get, and placing him at an early-stage portco I think would be amazing. For one, so we could hang out a lot. He has all the magic of incredibly talented, driven, and fun.<br>
					— Partner, early stage VC</p>
				<p>JJ is so chill.<br>
					— Founder, series A biotech</p>
				<p>The technology is revolutionary for the petroleum industry in how it combines the robustness of the known physics, the speed of data science, and the modern software design.<br>
					– Professor of Petroleum Engineering, Top 50 university</p>
				<p>Ooo ok ok.<br>
					— Investor, growth stage VC</p>
				<p>He is the designer that one could hope to work with.<br>
					— VP Design, series B cybersecurity tech</p>

				<p>FAQs</p>
				<p>Fractional?<br>
					A fractional designer is a part-timer who offers strategic guidance and hands on when needed to your team without the commitment of a full-time hire.</p>
				<p>First designer?<br>
					I was the first designer leading 0→1 design at more than a dozen exciting startups including Vaxxinity, OpenGov, Tachyus, Halo Industries, Spring Science, to name a few. If you truly value design, it’s never too early to hire your first designer.</p>
				<p>Working style?<br>
					I embed myself into your team and work directly with founders to provide clarity, optimism, and opportunity to shape innovative thinking. If I have one best design solution, I am not gonna make more design options just because you want to see more. You hire me because you want the best work, not close seconds.</p>
				<p>Feedback and revisions?<br>
					Seamlessly blendeded into your existing tools, be it Slack, Teams (sigh~), Google Docs, Asana, etc. I use whatever you use, email and text included.</p>
				<p>Sensitive/proprietary info and IP?<br>
					I maintain strict confidentiality. I don’t lock up the design work produced, it’s 100% yours.</p>
				<p>Unlimited design requests?<br>
					Yes, just like a full-time employee. New requests go into your queue and I'll knock them out one by one. Although I will definitely push back on some unreasonable requests.</p>
				<p>Turnaround time?<br>
					A couple days for most requests. Maybe a week for more complex ones. I also offer rush job for a fee. Need double speed? I charge double price.</p>
				<p>Unlimited revisions?<br>
					Always.</p>
				<p>Cancel anytime?<br>
					Anytime.</p>
				<p>Refund?<br>
					Do you ask for a refund on a dinner you didn't like?</p>
				<p>Hidden cost?<br>
					I don’t offer web or software development. If you’d like to work with a full design & dev service, I can recommend my trusted partners and I can work with you as a creative & design director to guide you through the whole process.</p>
