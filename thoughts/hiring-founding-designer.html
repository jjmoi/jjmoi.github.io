				<p>Startup Playbook<br>
					How to Find Your Founding Designer

				<p>I know a guy who knows a guy, who knows another guy. Hit me up if you need an intro. That’s usually how it starts.</p>
				<p>But really, hiring your first designer at a startup isn’t a job board affair, it’s whispered introductions, backchannel referrals, and late night text messages. Because the best designers are not out there broadcasting availability. They’re buried in work, quietly shaping products you already admire but never realized they touched.</p>
				<p>Every founder feels the squeeze. The market is chaotic, and the myth persists that “top” designers only come stamped with FAANG pedigrees. But pedigree is not what you need. At a startup, end-to-end doesn’t mean shipping one feature over nine months. It means birthing an entire product suite from a sketch on a napkin. That’s a different skill set entirely.</p>

				<p>The designer you’re looking for is a generalist with taste and judgment. They can draw the map, build the prototype, sweat the details, and still step back to ask if the whole thing even makes sense. Think more Da Vinci than feature factory. They thrive in ambiguity, love to navigate the fog, balance speed with clarity, and care about the essence of the product, not just its surface.</p>
				<p>They want to work on things that matter. They want ownership, autonomy, and founders who treats design as a core discipline. A designer can tell immediately if you see them as equal partner or an accessory.</p>
				<p>They’re not gonan hang out in obvious places. Look for freelancers who’ve quietly built entire products from scratch. Look for the first designers at small teams doing the heavy lifting. Look for people solving problems, not chasing clout. Follow the trail of products you admire back to the people that shaped them.</p>
				<p>When you do meet one, run a process that respects their craft. Skip the whiteboard puzzles because it’s imppossible to actually assess the quality anyway. Instead, bring them your real mess and see how they think, how they question, how they balance vision within constraint. The right designer will push back on your ideas, refine it, and oftentimes dismantle it so it can be rebuilt stronger.</p>
				<p>Outplay big tech with purpose. Show them design is part of your company’s DNA. Write a job description that speaks like a human with empathy and wit and creativity. Share your philosophy, your conviction that design is central, not cosmetic. Philosophers from Aristotle to Taoists understood, form and essence are inseparable. That’s what great designers bring to your company.</p>
				<p>Hiring your first designer isn’t about chasing unicorns. It’s about clarity. It’s about treating design as foundational and you’ll attract the ones who want to build the thing you actually need, a product people love to use.</p>
