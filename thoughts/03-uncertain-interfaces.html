				<p>Uncertain Interfaces<br>

				<p>AI systems are non-deterministic and uncertain. They guess, assign likelihoods, and generate outputs that feel certain even when the underlying model is not. Most AI products stumble in the gray zones of ambiguity. The real work of design is to make that ambiguity visible, actionable, and trustworthy.</p>
				<p>Models are confident even when dead wrong. Their fluency is easily mistaken for accuracy, which can mislead even skilled professionals. Uncertainty is not noise to be hidden, it is a signal for decision-making. In highly regulated industry like legal work, ignoring uncertainty undermines trust and heightens liability. If an AI tool flags a contract clause as compliant with high confidence, but is actually drawing from a narrow training set, the mistake can cascade into regulatory exposure. Designing for uncertainty has to be core of the product integrity.</p>

				<p>Disclose uncertainty in a way users can interpret with quantitative patterns like confidence bands, likelihood ranges, and probability scores or the qualitative ones like contextual disclaimers. Progressive disclosure keeps interfaces clean while leaving depth available. When a system highlights a potentially risky contract clause, it may first show a simple confidence score. If the user expands, the system reveals rationale, sources, or precedents. Interaction nudges are critical here. A legal AI assistant should not only present its output but also steer the user toward verification when uncertainty is high, suggesting human review and encouraging cross-checks against external sources.</p>
				<p>Note that whether the confidence score actually corresponds to reliability or truth is a deeper issue and is a story for another time. For now we should treat them as communication tools, not ground truth. The accuracy and calibration of these scores is a technical challenge that deserves its own exploration.</p>

				<p>Legal work by definition requires traceability. The user interfaces should support reversibility at multiple levels. Undo and rollback are the simplest safeguards. Provenance trails go further, showing why a model reached a conclusion and which sources influenced it. Decision history should not be a thin log but a navigable record of how the system evolved its recommendations. When an attorney challenges a risk assessment, the system should allow exploration of prior states, making reversibility a functional safety net rather than a superficial control.</p>
				<p>When models lack confidence, the worst outcome is false authority. AI-native products must be able to say: “I don’t know.” This means it must defer to human expertise rather than producing speculative interpretations presented as fact. Escalation can take many forms: routing a clause for partner review, pausing workflow until confirmation, or labeling outputs explicitly as draft. Just as a junior associate knows when to escalate an issue, an AI assistant that defers is more credible than one that speculates.</p>

				<p>Static interfaces are inadequate for probabilistic systems. Adaptive UIs adjust to context, showing concise risk summaries when confidence is high and expanding with reasoning and citations when it drops. Adaptation should also operate across roles, offering detailed references and risks to lawyers, but simplified the explanations to clients. However, it is important to distinguish adaptive design from personalization. Personalized UIs shape content based on a user’s history or preferences. Adaptive UIs adjust based on role and situational stakes. In legal AI, this distinction is critical.</p>
				<p>Designing AI-native products isn’t about making systems appear flawless. It’s all about surfacing the edges of competence. Adaptive interfaces that disclose uncertainty, support reversibility, and escalate responsibly build resilience into workflows. Law is one of the clearest domains where this matters, but the principle extends across every field where outcomes are consequential. Designing for uncertainty is the foundation of trust in AI.</p>
