				<p>As a piece of widespread federal efforts to improve the public’s experience of government digital services, we needed a secure and compliant platform that helps federal agencies deliver services the public deserves in a faster and user-centered way.</p>

<p>Built as a companion to the U.S. Web Design System, cloud.gov offers a fast way for federal agencies to develop and host websites, APIs, and applications that follow the USWDS guidelines while also are distinguishable from products made by other agencies. In the first few months that I joined 18F, the team had just launched the first beta version of the design system and the team were ready to expand the system to cover more use cases; not just expanding the UI components to include things like data visualizations and mobile native apps, but to actually build and launch products right on the platform. In a nutshell, cloud.gov is GitHub Pages in beast mode for government with built-in customizable design systems and it complies with federal security requirements from the start.</p>
				<p>Tons of research for the central design system has already been done, so to get up to speed on the topic, I started conducting a quick and dirty literature review of past research and documentation to better understand how the design system has been made. I then proceeded to interview the project leads and product owners, UX researchers, early adopters, and potential users to identify the different user needs for internal products. This allowed me to compare themes and patterns of user behaviors across sources and quickly compare the value of new ideas against the current design system.</p>

				<p>Before I could actually get down to work on cloud.gov, I still needed to understand how to practically use the design system itself, so I familiarize myself with it by working on several other products that were already using the design system. Because of that, I also got to improve the usability of the design system documentation website itself as well by simplifying the information architecture, improving navigation, and expanding the UI components to cover the different needs of newer products. Additional production files, responsive grid templates, symbols, and character styles were created to help designers and developers set up quickly. A few of these are detailed guides for designers and developers to get a quick start, specific examples of how UI components should be used, and basic templates that can be used and deployed within weeks.</p>
				<p>Once I learned all the ins and outs, I started an experiment by creating more robust templates with the existing UI components and tried to stretch the limit as far out as possible. Inspired by website builders like Squarespace and the likes, I mocked up several cool looking templates, then worked backwards to design the web builder and controls to get to those desired outputs. Collaborating with the core design system team along the way also allowed me to contribute back and improved the design system itself.</p>
				<p>Through all that work, I learned that while the design system is excellent in supporting design and development problem solving and providing consistency to teams and users, a design system doesn’t answer all design decisions. In fact, teams make their first design decisions way before they get to the design patterns. The problem with design systems is that having a library of design components can sometimes give the impression that all the design work has been completed. Although patterns do help teams hesitate less and build things in shorter amounts of time, it is the how and the why a group of patterns and components are stitched together that results in great design.</p>

				<p>To build suitable user interfaces on top of the design system, it's critical to decide on the structure with clear hierarchy and a logical reading order. And all government websites and applications shouldn’t look exactly the same because trust and recognition are not universal. Instead, the design must match the tone and subject matter of each agency’s unique mission. This clear direction helped limit the scope and provided constraints for the publishing engine.</p>
				<p>Putting it to use, we knew we needed to do more to build trust with stakeholders, especially when they all are very opinionated designers and developers. Most partner agencies initially used the design systems for their websites off the shelf so there was this stickinest that prevented them to move to cloud.gov. One of the ways we addressed that was by designing and building real live sites using the new templates to demonstrate the possibilities. We tested it first with blog posts because of the high visibility, then gradually moved on to update the whole 18F's website itself and other public facing products.</p>

				<p>After a year of the beta run, we had a running tally of hundreds of teams using cloud.gov, making websites and applications with rich content and intricate data visualizations. Notable partner agencies such as Treasury, Interior, Education, the White House, Defense, NASA, and Homeland Security make products every day, and over 100 million people in the last quarter alone were exposed to those services.</p>
				<p>We continued to see more and more agencies begin relying on cloud.gov building great accessible products and services in record time, and seeing more agencies followed how we expanded on the U.S. Web Design System creating their own versions to fit different organization and product needs.</p>
