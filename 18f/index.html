				<p>As one of the pieces of widespread federal efforts to improve the public’s experience of government digital services and to serve more products in the future, we needed an extension for the design system that, while following the same design guidelines, it should also be distinguishable from products made by all other partner agencies.</p>

				<p>USWDS: The U.S. Web Design System (fka U.S. Web Design Standards) is a library of design guidelines and code to help the federal government build accessible and responsive digital services. In the first few months that I joined 18F, the team had just launched the first beta version of the Design System, and we wanted to expand the system to cover more use cases such as dashboards, data visualizations, and mobile native apps.</p>
				<p>Tons of research for the central design system has already been done, so to get up to speed on the topic, I started conducting a quick and dirty literature review of past research and documentation to better understand how the design system has been made. I then proceeded to interview the project leads and product owners, UX researchers, early adopters, and potential users to identify the different user needs for internal products. This allowed me to compare themes and patterns of user behaviors across sources and quickly compare the value of new ideas against the current design system.</p>

				<p>While the design system is excellent in supporting design and development problem solving and providing consistency to teams and users, a design system doesn’t answer all design decisions. In fact, teams make their first design decisions way before they get to the design patterns. The problem with design systems is that having a library of design components can sometimes give the impression that all the design work has been completed. Although patterns do help teams hesitate less and build things in shorter amounts of time, it is the how and the why a group of patterns and components are stitched together that results in great design.</p>
				<p>USWDS give flexibility so teams can build the right solution for users, but there are still plenty of design decisions that teams need to make to be successful. And if a website doesn’t look trustworthy, users will proceed with caution or worse, give up. To build suitable user interfaces on top of the design system, the team still needs to decide on the structure with clear hierarchy and a logical reading order. And all government websites and applications shouldn’t look exactly the same because trust and recognition are not universal. Instead, the design must match the tone and subject matter of each agency’s unique mission. This is where Federalist and cloud.gov steps in to help quickly jumpstart new projects.</p>
				<p>Around the same time, I was also working on several other high-visibility internal products, so it was just perfect to create the extended design system by consolidating the UI components. Additional production files, responsive grid templates, Sketch symbols, and character styles were created to help designers and developers set up quickly (yes, we weren't allowed to use Figma or the many other online tools because, laws). Collaborating with the core design system team allowed us to develop various ways to improve both systems. A few of these are detailed guides for designers and developers to get a quick start, specific examples of how UI components should be used, and templates that can be used and deployed within weeks.</p>
				<p>I also improved the usability of the documentation website itself by simplifying the information architecture, putting the components front and center, improving navigation, and expanding the visual design to cover the different needs of each product.</p>

				<p>Putting it to use, we knew we needed to do more to build trust with stakeholders, especially when they all are very opinionated designers and developers. One of the ways we addressed that was by designing and building real live sites using the new extended design system to demonstrate all the possibilities. We tested it first with blog posts because of the high visibility, then gradually moved on to update the whole 18F's website itself and high usage internal products.</p>
				<p>The next step was to turn this into a theme engine within the public-facing publishing platform, so this could also work for partner agencies. While most partner agencies initially used the design systems for their websites off the shelf, we started to see more agencies following how we expanded on the core design system, and tuned the subsystem to fit different business and product needs.</p>

				<p>After a year of the beta run, we had a running tally of hundreds of teams using Federalist, making websites and applications with rich content and intricate data visualizations. Notable partner agencies such as Treasury, Interior, Education, the White House, Defense, NASA, and Homeland Security make products every day, and over 100 million people in the last quarter were exposed to those services. We continued to see more and more agencies begin relying on Federalist and cloud.gov building great accessible products and services.</p>
