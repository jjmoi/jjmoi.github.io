				<p>USWDS: The U.S. Web Design System is a library of design guidelines and code to help the federal government build accessible and responsive digital services. To be able to separate 18F's internal tools from the public facing products, 18F needs an extension design system that while follows the same design guidelines, the products made in-house will be easily recognizable and distinguishable from products made by all other agencies.</p>

				<p>In the first few months I joined 18F, the team has just launched the first beta version of the United States Web Design System (fka U.S. Web Design Standards). The system was just starting to make some news and the data of actual usage was actually still very limited so I set out to research how designers and developers were using it.</p>
				<p>Tons of research for the main design system has already been done so to get up to speed on the topic, I started there conducting a quick and dirty literature review the past research and documentations that includes referencing published academic papers  subject area (and sometimes a particular time period) to gain an u to analyze the information collected. I then proceeded to interview the project leads and product owners, UX researchers, early adopters, and potential users to identify the different user needs for internal products. This allowed me to compare themes and patterns of user behaviors across sources and quickly compare the value of new ideas against older system.</p>

				<p>At the same time, I was also working on several other high visibility internal products, so it was just perfect to create the extended design system by consolidating the production files and adding responsive grid templates, Sketch symbols, and character styles to help designers and developers set up quickly (yes, we weren't allowed to use Figma or the many other online tools because, laws and regulations). Collaborating with the main design system team allowed us to came up with various ways to improve both systems. A few of which is, a detailed guides for designers and developers to get a quick start, added specific examples on how UI components should be used, and began creating templates that can be used and deployed in weeks time.</p>
				<p>I also improved the usability of the documentation website itself by simpliflying the information architecture, putting the components front and center, improving navigation, and expanding the visual design to cover different needs of each product.</p>

				<p>Putting it to use, we knew we needed to do more to build trust of stakeholders especially when they all are very opinionated designers and developers. One of the ways we addressed that was by designing and building real live sites using the new extended design system to demonstrate all the possibilities. We tested it first with blog posts because of the high visibility, then gradually moved on to update the whole website, and port the implementation to the other accounts I was working on such as <a href="https://cloud.gov" target="_blank">cloud.gov</a> and <a href="https://federalist.18f.gov" target="_blank">Federalist</a>.</p>
				<p>The next step was to turn this into a theme engine within the public facing publishing platform so this could work for partner agencies as well. While at first, most partner agencies used the design systems for their websites off the shelf, we started to see more agencies followed how we tuned the main design system to match with different brands and needs.</p>
