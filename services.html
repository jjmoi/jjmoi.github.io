				<p>WHAT PEOPLE SAY</p>
				<p>What sets JJ apart in an entirely different (and better) category is how smart, helpful, and humble he is. He took the time to understand our business and technology better than anyone else, and thus were able to add more value. He also is a thought leader – and leaders in general – not looking to others for social proof – they are bold enough and smart enough to be strong and supportive. Finally, and on top of all of that, he shares my goal of making the world a better place, and I very much look forward to doing just that with him.<br>— Bill Gross, Founder at Idealab, Heliogen, Energy Vault, and CarbonCapture</p>
				<p>I like your work. Let's work together.<br>— Joe Lonsdale, Founder and Managing Partner at 8VC, Founder at Palantir, Addepar, Investor in Anduril, Oculus, Flexport, and Joby Aviation</p>
				<p>We are incredibly excited to partner with JJ because of how impressed we quickly became by the experience, work ethic, and service mindset. We're strong believers in the ability of JJ to execute and add value, and we are looking forward to working together to improve the lives of billions across the world.<br>— Andrei Iancu, Founder & CEO at Halo</p>
				<p>This is just amazing. I cannot express how much I love the design.<br>— Suzanne Fletcher, General Partner of Zelda Ventures</p>
				<p>You are so great at capturing people's hearts.<br>— Liz Stein, Managing Director at US Innovative Technology Fund</p>
				<p>This is an amazing software platform to handle single-cell phenotypes. I haven’t seen anything else on the market like it.<br>— Head of Imaging at Big Pharma</p>
				<p>Affordable homes, good paying jobs, reliable mass transit, and an overarching view of resiliency and sustainability - that's what the product allows us to track.<br>Mayor Jane Castor of of Tampa, FL</p>
				<p>I seriously do wish we had a spot open here at the firm for you right now. Nevertheless I'm determined to rope you into the 8VC Design Family as close to us as we can get, and placing you at an early-stage Build co I think would be amazing. For one, so we could hang out a lot. You have all the magic of incredibly talented, driven, and fun.<br>— Luke Bugbee, Head of Design at 8VC</p>
				<p>We are always thinking about you for our portfolio companies.<br>— Deny Khoung, Partner at 8VC</p>
				<p>JJ is so chill.<br>— Francisco LePort, Founder & CEO at Gordian Biotechnology</p>
				<p>A truly invaluable partner, he is a superhero trouble shooter and offer untold amounts of strategic insight, support, and engagement. We have built numerous companies and have never had such a thoughtful, connected, and invested partner.<br>— Mei Mei Hu, Founder & CEO at Vaxxinity</p>
				<p>I just love everything you touch.<br>— Brandon Simmons, Investor in Venus Aerospace, Space Perspective, CarbonCapture, Elevian, and Pyka</p>
				<p>You are the designer that one could hope to work with.<br>— Zach Johnston, VP Design at Twingate</p>
				<p>Ooo ok ok.<br>— Ben Blumenrose, Founder & Managing Partner at Designer Fund, Investor in Stripe, Gusto, and Framer</p>

				<p>FAQs</p>
				<p>Fractional?<br>A fractional design leader is part-timer who offers strategic guidance and hands on when needed to your team without the commitment of a full-time hire.</p>
				<p>First designer?<br>I am the first designer leading 0→1 design at more than a dozen startups including Vaxxinity, OpenGov, Tachyus, Halo Industries, to name a few. It’s never too early to hire your first designer.</p>
				<p>Embedded?<br>I embed myself into your team and work directly with founders to provide clarity, optimism, and opportunity to shape innovative thinking.</p>
				<p>Working style?<br>If I have one best design solution, I am not gonna make more design options just because you want to see them. You hire me because you want the best work, not close seconds.</p>
				<p>Feedback and revisions?<br>Seamlessly blendeded into your existing tools, be it Slack, Teams (sigh~), Google Docs, Asana, etc. I use whatever you use, email and text included.</p>
				<p>Sensitive or proprietary info and IP?<br>I maintain strict confidentiality. I don’t lock up the design work produced, it’s 100% yours.</p>				
				<p>Unlimited design requests?<br>Yes, just like a full-time employee. New requests go into your queue and I'll knock them out one by one. Although I will definitely push back on some unreasonable requests.</p>
				<p>Turnaround time?<br>A couple days for most requests. Maybe a week for more complex ones.</p>
				<p>Unlimited revisions?<br>Always.</p>
				<p>Cancel anytime?<br>Anytime.</p>
				<p>Refund?<br>Do you ask for a refund on a dinner you didn't like?</p>
				<p>Hidden cost?<br>I don’t offer web or software development. If you’d like to work with a full design & dev service, I can recommend my trusted partners and I can work with you as a fractional design leader to help you review the design along the way.</p>
