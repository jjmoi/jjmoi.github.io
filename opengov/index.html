				<p>Over the last decade, a growing number of government organizations have begun to make budgetary and financial data available online. Governments began to ask themselves, "How can we make our finances more transparent?" since merely making those difficult-to-understand 500-page budget sheet PDFs available for download isn't enough.</p>

				<p>As the first employee at OpenGov, I was tasked with tackling this difficult challenge. Early prototypes were developed to assess market demand for a better way to display the government's massive financial data. As we gained more consumers, we received a stream of feedback, which assisted us in identifying several major issues. We evaluated the feature requests, bug tickets, and market reports, key issues and themes began to emerge, such as confusing navigation and filter tools that are difficult to discover. We ran several usability tests remotely, confirming the same core issues.</p>
				<p>One of the most important findings is that the aesthetic is misleading. When we asked people to describe their impressions of the product, we often heard remarks about how sleek it felt, which contradicts the product's promises of evoking sentiments of transparency. As a result, we decided to make a big change. And after months of user research and usability testing, the ideas began to flow. Slowing down long enough to capture each new idea proved our greatest challenge.</p>

				<p>To avoid making the error of leaping from high-fidelity mockups to putting out the final product, we spent a week hacking together a prototype to test with customers. We put together a just barely functional prototype to test with our pilot customers. We got down with a number of city officials, including representatives from the finance department and the mayor’s office, and let them experience the updated design.</p>
				<p>The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. After a few rapid iterations based on the feedback, we conducted another round of user interviews and usability testing with a few additional selected beta customers. I recall walking into each user interview with the concern that they might prefer the old design. Thankfully, the customers approved of our improvements. We hunkered down and spent the following two months producing the final product with that confirmation in hand.</p>
				<p>I made accessibility a top priority from the start. Not only do we need to be Section 508 compliant because we engage with government institutions, but I genuinely believe that data should be available to as many people as possible. I conducted extensive research on accessibility and examined countless best practices to help develop the core palette of 40 colors for our interface. The colors were then divided into smaller groups for different kinds of visualizations (with the hope that we would never need to use all 40 colors). We then made appropriate use of alt tags and placed descriptive titles directly on graphs whenever possible to further enhance usability. We also intended to release our design guidelines and research to the public as open source for the public to use for data visualization projects.</p>

				<p>Now with everything in place, we are ready to onboard the massive amount of new customers (almost a hundred local governments at the time). The color theming system then enabled us to quickly automate the personalization for a customer's overall user interface and controls, duotone icons, and data visualization based on their brand colors, to create a interface that seems unified yet feel distinctive from one another.</p>

				<p>We spent three weeks after the development was completed performing more detailed user testing and customer interviews. With several rapid iterations, the new version resulted in a five-fold increase in sales in the following quarters, and our sales picked up significantly. Within six months, we had analyzing $50B worth of government expenditure throughout the country, and thousands of engaged citizens interact with the site on a daily basis, connecting to their cities' financials and performance with this new medium of open data.</p>

				<p>Updated 2021:<br />It's been almost a decades since I designed this product but it still looks as good as it's designed not too long ago and very little has been changed since. The product suite is still going strong and hitting more than a thousand government customers nationwide. I'm very proud of what the product has grown to become, and many thanks to my amazing co-designer Zach Johnston who helped push the possibilities and the teams who’re still taking good care of the product.</p>
