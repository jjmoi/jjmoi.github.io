				<p>Over the last decade, an increasing number of government agencies have begun to provide their budgeting and financial data online. Governments started to question, “How can we make our finances more transparent?” because simply putting those difficult to decipher 500-page budget document PDFs up for download isn’t enough.</p>

				<p>I joined OpenGov as the first employee to help tackle this challenging problem. Early prototypes were created to evaluate the market’s demand for a better method to show the government’s vast financial data. As we acquired more customers, we also received a plethora of feedback which helped us discover many significant problems. As we reviewed the feature requests, bug tickets, and market reports, key issues and themes started to shape form such as confusing navigation and filter tools that are difficult to discover. We ran several usability tests remotely, confirming the same core issues.</p>

				<p>There’s no feeling quite like the moment your pencil first hits paper on a new project. After months of research and testing, the ideas started to flow. Slowing down long enough to capture each new idea proved our greatest challenge.</p>
				<p>One of the core discoveries is that the aesthetic is misleading. When we asked people to describe their impressions of the product, we often heard comments about how sleek it felt, which is against the promises of the product that should evoke more feelings of transparency and honesty. And so we decided to do a major overhaul.</p>

				<p>To avoid making the mistake of jumping from high-fidelity mockups to building out the final product, we took a week to hack together a prototype to test with customers. We slapped together a (just barely) working prototype to experiment with our pilot customers, the City of Palo Alto and Santa Cruz. We sat down with a number of city officials, including people from the finance department and the mayor’s office, and let them experience the updated product.</p>
				<p>After we iterated on a few pressing issues learned from the initial feedback, we did another round of user interviews and usability testing with a few more selected beta customers, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. I remember walking into each customer interview, fearing that this customer would prefer the old design. Thankfully, the customers affirmed our changes. With that validation in hand, we bunkered down and spent the next two months building the final product.</p>

				<p>To onboard the massive amount of new customers (almost a hundred local governments at the time), we also rolled out the color theming system. Based on the customer's brand colors, it allows us to quickly automate the personalization for the overall user interface and data visualization.</p>

				<p>After development came to a head, we spent three weeks conducting more thorough user tests and customer interviews. With several rapid iterations, the new version then gained us five times increase in sales in the following quarters, and our sales picked up significantly. Within six months, we were analyzing $50B worth of government spending across the nation, and thousands of engaged citizens interact with the site daily, connecting to their cities' financials and performance through this new medium of open data.</p>

				<p>Updated 2021:<br />It's been almost a decades since I designed this product but it still looks as good as it's designed not too long ago and very little has been changed since. The product suite is still going strong and hitting more than a thousand government customers nationwide. I'm very proud of what the product has grown to become, and many thanks to my amazing co-designer Zach Johnston who helped push the possibilities and the teams who’re still taking good care of the product.</p>
