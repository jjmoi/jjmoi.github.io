<h1>Tachyus</h1>
<p>Optimizing energy production for the oil and gas industry</p>

<img src="hero"/>

<p>Oil and gas industry is one of the most important industries on the planet. It’s the reason most of us are able to go places, it's the reason most of us get our food. Tachyus creates technology to optimize oil and gas production with data and physics.</p>
<p>I was a principal designer embedded in the product/web team working closely with two product managers and four full-stack engineers.</p>

<h2>Back to the Future Part II</h2>
<p>The plot of Back to the Future Part II is useful as an analogy to understand how Tachyus' products work. The movie is about this high school kid and his friend who's a disgraced nuclear physicist who build a time machine, fly to the future 2015 (which we’re way passed that).</p>
<p>Their nemesis is there in the future and steals the time machine and takes a sports almanac back to his former self back in 1955. With that sports almanac, their nemesis is able to bet profitably for the next 50 years and becomes a gambling tycoon.</p>
<p>The thesis of this movie and Tachyus is that, if we can predict the future, we can make profitable decisions today. We might not have the sports almanac, but there are plenty other ways we can predict the future using data.</p>
<p>By using physics to constrain data science, and by using data science to augment physical simulations, you can infer what the future of data will look like.</p>

<h2>88mph</h2>
<p>Our data model is so complex we call it the hypercube. Its four dimensions are schema version, data versions, oil field, and history. That means, at each single point of time in the history of an oil well, there are hundreds of data versions, and you multiply that by decades of its life span.</p>
<p>For petroluem engineers to be able to easily make sense of those data and the hundreds of possible futures, we made our product flow in a similar fashion as the existing tools they normally use so they get a good head start at navigating the product and can focus more on the actual analysis work.</p>
