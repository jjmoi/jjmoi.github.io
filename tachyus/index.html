				<p>The oil and gas industry is one of the most critical industries on the planet. It’s the reason most of us can go places, it’s the reason most of us can get our food. Tachyus creates technology to optimize oil and gas production with data. And physics.</p>

				<p>The plot of Back to the Future Part II is helpful as an analogy to understand how Tachyus' products work. The movie was about this high school kid and his friend, who's a disgraced nuclear physicist who built a time machine, flew to the (to be) future 2015, messed things up, and tried to correct their mistakes.</p>
				<p>Minor spoiler alert in case you haven't watched this 30-year-old film: their nemesis from present-day was also there in the future and stole the time machine and took a sports almanac back to his former self back in 1955. With the sports almanac, the nemesis was able to bet profitably for the next 50 years and became a gambling tycoon.</p>
				<p>The common thesis of this movie and Tachyus is that if we can predict the future, we can make profitable decisions today. We might not have the sports almanac, but there are plenty other ways to predict the future using data. As the first employee and the only designer for 6 years, I worked with a small but nimble team of brilliant software engineers to connect the centuries-old industry with future technology to empower oil & gas producers to make data-driven decisions.</p>

				<p>The methods engineers and scientists usually employ to predict a scenario in physics are with differential equations, and they solve them to figure out what's going to happen. People can also predict using statistical data, looking at historical data, and infer what the future of data will look like. What we thought is that the best way to predict the future is by combining these two paradigms by using physics to constrain data science and by using data science to quicken and augment physical simulations. By doing so, our data science model is so complex we gave it the moniker of Hypercube, inspired by its four data dimensions: schema, versions, geolocation, and history. That means, at each single point of time in the history of an oil well, there are hundreds of data versions, multiplying that by the well's decades of life span, and you get a colossal amount of data to analyze.</p>
				<p>The data model predicted not just one future, but countless possible futures (think Doctor Strange, who saw all 14 million scenarios) with some uncertainty built in, and we could actually calculate both risk and reward for each scenario. In analogy to Back to the Future II, the question is, what do I bet on as Biff in 1984 and over the next 50 years? Imagine that over the next 50 years, there are gonna be thousands of possibilities of betting on team A or team B, and all of these outcomes stack up to one metric of risk/reward and cost. We took an operational plan for an oil field composed of thousands of decisions and mapped those with our predictive engine into one point in the space of oil production vs cost or risk or any additional metric in the financial decision-making process.</p>
				<p>With our predictive engine that runs thousands of times faster than most, we were able to evolve from the base scenario using algorithms to help customers implement towards a series of optimal operational plans for decades out.</p>

				<p>User research in enterprises has always been a struggle to recruit participants, especially in the oil & gas industry, that there are only a handful of major companies globally. So for petroleum engineers to be able to easily make sense of the massive data, we decided to make our product flow in a similar fashion as the existing tools they normally use to cut down on learning curve, so they get a good head start at navigating the product and can focus more on the actual analysis work. In order to learn how people interact with the product with limited access to the users, I initiated several programs of UX training and workshop to equip our local sales engineers with the ability to conduct user interviews and usability testing when they meet with prospective customers.</p>
				<p>Since we worked with international customers from the start, localization for people in non-English speaking countries was also crucial. It was challenging to say the least, to design the user interface to provide bidirectional text support (BiDi) so that the software can combine script from right to left (RTL) and left to right (LTR) writing systems, which generally contain different types of alphabets such as Arabic and Hebrew.</p>

				<p>To accommodate one of our customers and to close a deal, we had to deliver the product in half the time we had planned. We had precisely 2 weeks to deliver the beta! Fortunately at this point, we had a good amount of research and could make good educated guesses for most things. This allowed me to skip the wireframing roads and instead used thoughtful shortcuts for things such as UI flows and utilized Apple’s default human interface guidelines for most things.</p>

				<p>For the following iterations, I created a design system with CSS-ready UI components to help speed up the development. Based on Atomic Design, I named it <a href= “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model”>Standard Model</a>, borrowed from the particle physics theory, and subsequently renamed the system stages to atoms, molecules, compounds, substances, and matters to make the convention easier to grasp.</p>
				<p>I also created a system for different shades and tints that can expand a given color to be a set of 10 colors for data visualizations. Also had too much fun naming the colors inspired by fictional elements such as Mithril Gray, Rearden Blue, Adamantium Lime, Element-99 orange, Orichalcum Salmon, and Kryptonite Green. In addition to the design system, I also laid out our design principles and called for the developers to join me in the Delorean and implement UX decisions where they could with little guidance. This freed me to further polish the visual design and jump in to help with frontend code where needed.</p>

				<p>One of the most memorable quotes from Back To The Future II is that the future is whatever you make, so you should make it a good one. I had the opportunity to use digital and technology to transform one of the most traditional industries for the better, and I was glad to see we really have never lived in a time like now where we can embrace technology, embrace the changes, and use it for good. The future is today, and I'm making it a good one.</p>
