				<p>Oil and gas industry is one of the most important industries on the planet. It’s the reason most of us are able to go places, it's the reason most of us get our food. Tachyus creates technology to optimize oil and gas production with data and physics.</p>

				<p>The plot of Back to the Future Part II is useful as an analogy to understand how Tachyus' products work. The movie was about this high school kid and his friend who's a disgraced nuclear physicist who built a time machine, flew to the (to be) future 2015, messed things up, and tried to correct their mistakes.</p>
				<p>Minor spoiler alert: their nemesis from present day was also there in the future and stole the time machine and took a sports almanac back to his former self back in 1955. With the sports almanac, the nemesis was able to bet profitably for the next 50 years and became a gambling tycoon.</p>

				<p>People can also predict using statistical data, looking at the past data, and infer what the future of data will look like. What we thought is that the best way to predict the future is by combining these two paradigms by using physics to constrain data science, and by using data science to quicken and augment physical simulations.</p>

				<p>Our data model is so complex we gave it the hypercube moniker. Its four dimensions are schema version, data versions, geolocation, and history. That means, at each single point of time in the history of an oil well, there are hundreds of data versions, multiplying that by its decades of life span, and you get a colossal amount of data to work with.</p>
				<p>For petroleum engineers to be able to easily make sense of the data and countless of possible futures (think Doctor Strange who saw all 14 million scenarios), we made our product flow in a similar fashion as the existing tools they normally use so they get a good head start at navigating the product and can focus more on the actual analysis work.</p>

				<p>The model predicted not just one future, but multiple futures with some uncertainty built in, and we could actually calculate both risk and reward for each scenario. The question in analogy to Back to the Future is what do I bet on as Biff in year 1984 and over the next 50 years? Imagine that over the next 50 years, there are gonna be thousands of possibilities of betting on who of the 30 NBA teams would win the playoffs, and all of these outcomes stack up to one metric of risk/reward and cost.</p>
				<p>We took an operational plan for an oil field which is composed of thousands of decisions and we mapped those with our predictive engine into one point in the space of oil production vs cost or risk or any additional metric in the financial decision making process. With our predictive engine that runs thousands of times faster than most, we're able to evolve from the base scenario using algorithms to help customers implement towards a series of optimal operational plans for decades out.</p>

				<p>Usability testing in enterprises has always been a struggle to find participants, especially in the oil & gas industry that there are only a handful of companies globally. That meant localization for customers in non-english speaking countries was also crucial. It was challenging to say the least designing the interface to provide bidirectional text support (BiDi) so that the software can combine script from right to left (RTL) and left to right (LTR) writing systems, which generally contain different types of alphabets such as Arabic and Hebrew.</p>
				<p>To make it work, I facilitated several trainings and workshops to get our local sales engineers on the same page on user experience and how to conduct user interviews and usability testing to supplement our user research efforts, so when they meet with prospect customers and got access to end users, they could sneak in and do mini versions of user research here and there, and could report insights back to the team effectively.</p>
				<p>The plot only thickens. To accommodate one of our customers and to close a deal, we had to deliver the product in half the time we’ve planned. We had 2 weeks to deliver this beta! Fortunately at this point, we had a good amount of research and could make good educated guesses for most things. This allowed me to skip the wireframing roads and instead used thoughtful shortcuts for many things such as UI flows.</p>
				<p>To speed things up even more, I made a MVP version of our design system with CSS ready UI components. Based on Atomic Design, I named it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard Model</a> borrowed from the particle physics theory, and subsequently renamed the system stages to atoms, molecules, compounds, substances, and matters.</p>
				<p>I also created a system for different shades and tints that can further expand a given color to be a set of 10 colors total for data visualizations. Also had a little fun naming the colors using fictional elements and particles such as Mithril Gray, Rearden Blue, Adamantium Lime, Element-99 orange, Orichalcum Salmon, and Kryptonite Green. I probably had too much coffee when coming up with the naming conventions.</p>
				<p>In addition to the design system, I also laid out our design principles called for the developers to join me in the Delorean and implement UX decisions where they can with little of my guidance. This freed me to finish the visual design and jump in to help with frontend codings.</p>
				<p>Here is a snapshot of the product’s ongoing evolution.</p>
				<p>The key line from Back to the Future is that, the future is what you make of it and you should make it a good one. In hindsight, I appreciated the rushed deadlines that forced me to rethink my design process and find creative ways to collaborate across teams better and faster.</p>
