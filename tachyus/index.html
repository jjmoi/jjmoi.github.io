<h1>Tachyus</h1>
<p>Optimizing energy production for the future of oil and gas industry</p>

<img src="hero"/>

<p>Oil and gas industry is one of the most important industries on the planet. It’s the reason most of us are able to go places, it's the reason most of us get our food. Tachyus creates technology to optimize oil and gas production with data and physics.</p>
<p>I was a principal designer embedded in the product/web team working closely with two product managers and four full-stack engineers.</p>

<h2>Back to the Future Part II</h2>
<p>The plot of Back to the Future Part II is useful as an analogy to understand how Tachyus' products work. The movie is about this high school kid and his friend who's a disgraced nuclear physicist who build a time machine, fly to the future 2015 (which we’re way passed that).</p>
<p>Their nemesis is there in the future and steals the time machine and takes a sports almanac back to his former self back in 1955. With that sports almanac, their nemesis is able to bet profitably for the next 50 years and becomes a gambling tycoon.</p>
<p>The thesis of this movie and Tachyus is that, if we can predict the future, we can make profitable decisions today. We might not have the sports almanac, but there are plenty other ways we can predict the future using data.</p>
<p>By using physics to constrain data science, and by using data science to augment physical simulations, you can infer what the future of data will look like.</p>

<h2>88mph</h2>
<p>Our data model is so complex we call it the hypercube. Its four dimensions are schema version, data versions, oil field, and history. That means, at each single point of time in the history of an oil well, there are hundreds of data versions, and you multiply that by decades of its life span.</p>
<p>For petroluem engineers to be able to easily make sense of those data and the hundreds of possible futures, we made our product flow in a similar fashion as the existing tools they normally use so they get a good head start at navigating the product and can focus more on the actual analysis work.</p>

<h2>Sending you back to the future<h2/>
<p>This is how our time machine looks like in analogy to Back to the Future. We predict not just one future, but multiple futures with some uncertainty built in, and we can actually calculate both risk and reward of each scenario.</p>
<p>The question is what do I bet on as Biff in year 1984 and over the next 50 years? So imagine over 50 years, there are thousands of possibilities of betting on team A or team B and all of these add up to one metric of risk/reward and cost.</p>
<p>We take an operational plan for an oil field which is also composed of thousands of decisions and we map those with our predictive engine into one point in the space of oil production vs cost or risk or any other metric in the financial decision making process.</p>
<p>With our predictive engine that runs thousands of times faster than the majority, we're able to evolve from the base scenario using algorithms. With these data in the future, we can then roll out with the customers using our product a series of plans to help them implement towards the optimal operational plan.</p>

<h2>Mr. Fusion</h2>
<p>Usability testing in enterprises has always been a struggle to find participants, especially in oil & gas. Add to that, the bigger customers, the less access to the end users. We also moved on to work with customers in non-english speaking countries which only makes it more challenging.</p>
<p>To make it work, I facilitated several mini trainings and workshops to get our local sales engineers on the same page on user experience and how to conduct user interviews and usability testing. So when they meet with users, they can sneak in and do mini versions of user research here and there, and they can report insights back to the team effectively.</p>

<h2>Where we’re going, we don't need roads</h2>
<p>The plot only thickens. To accommodate one of our customers and to close a deal, we had to deliver the product in half the time we’ve planned.</p>
<p>Fortunately at this point, we had a good amount of research and can make good educated guess for most things. This allowed me to skip the wireframing roads and instead used thoughtful shortcuts for many things such as UI flows.
</p>

<h2>Flux capacitor</h2>
<p>To speed things up even more, I made a MVP of our design system with CSS ready UI components for the developers to use. Borrowed from Atomic Design, I named our design system Standard Model and renamed the stages to make it fit better with our vernacular as Atoms, Molecules, Compounds, Substances, and Matters.</p>
<p>I also created a system for different shades and tints that can further expand a given color to be a set of ten total to display in data visualizations. I had a little fun naming the colors using fictional elements and particles such as Mithril Gray, Rearden Blue, Adamantum Lime, Element-99 orange, Orichalcum Salmon, and Kryptonite Green.</p>
<p>In addition to the design system, I also laid out our design principles called for the developers to join me in the Delorean and implement UX decisions where they can with little of my guidance. This freed me to finish the visual deisgn and jump in to help with frontend codings.</p>

<h2>To be continued…</h2>
<p>Here is a snapshot of the product’s ongoing evolution.</p>

<h2>Looking back</h2>
<p>The key line from Back to the Future is that, the future is what you make of it and you should make it a good one. Looking back, I appreciated the rushed times that forced me to rethink my design process and find creative ways to collaborate across teams better and faster.</p>
