<style class="tremolo box double-paragon-40" contenteditable>Melquíades’s prodding, José Arcadio Buendía begins to explore alchemy, the pseudo-science of making gold out</style>

<h3>36 pt Double Great Primer</h3>
<style class="tremolo box double-great-primer-36" contenteditable>of other metals. He is driven by a desire for progress and by an intense search for knowledge that forces him</style>

<h3>32 pt Double Columbian</h3>
<style class="tremolo box double-columbian-32" contenteditable>into solitude. Increasingly, he withdraws from human contact, becoming unkempt, antisocial, and interested only in his pursuit of knowledge.</style>

<h3>30 pt Five Line Nonpareil</h3>
<style class="tremolo box five-line-nonpareil-30" contenteditable>But José Arcadio Buendía is not always a solitary scientist. On the contrary, he is the leader who oversaw the building of the</style>

<h3>28 pt Double English</h3>
<style class="tremolo box double-english-28" contenteditable>village of Macondo, an idyllic place dedicated to hard work and order, filled with young people, and as yet, unvisited by death. In his</style>

<h3>24 pt Double Pica</h3>
<style class="tremolo box double-pica-24" contenteditable>quest for knowledge and progress, José Arcadio Buendía’s obsession shifts to a desire to establish contact with civilization. He leads an expedition to the</style>

<h3>22 pt Double Small Pica</h3>
<style class="tremolo box double-small-pica-22" contenteditable>north, since he knows there is only swamp to the west and south and mountains to the east. But he then decides that Macondo is surrounded by water and inaccessible to</style>

<h3>20 pt Paragon</h3>
<style class="tremolo box paragon-20" contenteditable>the rest of the world. When he plans to move Macondo to another, more accessible place, however, he is stopped by his wife, who refuses to leave. Thwarted, he turns his attention,</style>

<h3>18 pt Great Primer</h3>
<style class="tremolo box great-primer-18" contenteditable>finally, to his children: José Arcadio, who has inherited his father’s great strength, and Aureliano (later known as Colonel Aureliano Buendía), who seems, even as a child, enigmatic and withdrawn. When the gypsies return,</style>

<h3>16 pt Columbian</h3>
<style class="tremolo box columbian-16" contenteditable>they bring word that Melquíades is dead. Despite his sadness at the news, José Arcadio Buendía does not lose interest in new technology and marvels: when the gypsies show him ice, the patriarch of Macondo proclaims it the greatest invention in the world.</style>

<h3>14 pt English</h3>
<style class="tremolo box english-14" contenteditable>In telling the story of Macondo’s founding, the book now moves backward in time. The cousins José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula Iguarán are born in a small village, the great-grandchildren of those surviving Sir Francis Drake’s attack on Riohacha.</style>

<h3>12 pt Pica</h3>
<style class="tremolo box pica-12" contenteditable>Úrsula is afraid to consummate their marriage, as children of incest were said to have terrible genetic defects. There was precedent for this: two of their relatives gave birth to a child with a pig’s tail. But as time passes after their marriage, and Ursula continues to refuse to have sex</style>

<h3>11 pt Small Pica</h3>
<style class="tremolo box small-pica-11" contenteditable>out of fear of the genetic deformity of their child, the people of the village begin to mock José Arcadio Buendía. When a rival, Prudencio Aguilar, implies that Buendía is impotent, Buendía kills him. Haunted by guilt and the specter of Aguilar, José Arcadio Buendía decides to leave his home. After many months of wandering,</style>

<h3>10 pt Long Primer</h3>
<style class="tremolo box long-primer-10" contenteditable>they establish the village of Macondo. On seeing the ice of the gypsies, José Arcadio Buendía remembers his dream of Macondo as a city built with mirror-walls, which he interprets to mean ice. He immerses himself again in his scientific study, this time accompanied by his son Aureliano. Meanwhile, the older son, José Arcadio—still a teenager—is seduced by a local woman, Pilar Ternera, who is attracted to him because of the huge</style>

<h3>9 pt Bourgeois</h3>
<style class="tremolo box bourgeois-9" contenteditable>size of his penis. Eventually, he impregnates her. Before their child can be born, however, he meets a young gypsy girl and falls madly in love with her. When the gypsies leave town, José Arcadio joins them. Grief-stricken at the loss of her eldest son, Úrsula tries to follow the gypsies, leaving behind her newborn girl, Amaranta. Five months later, Úrsula returns, having discovered the simple, two-day journey through the swamp that connects Macondo with civilization.</style>

<h3>8 pt Brevier</h3>
<style class="tremolo box brevier-8" contenteditable>As a result of Úrsula Iguarán’s discovery of a route connecting Macondo with civilization, the village begins to change. The village grows along with the Buendía family, with José Arcadio Buendía playing a key role in the expansion of both. Pilar Ternera gives birth to the son of the missing José Arcadio. The boy is named Arcadio. Joining the family, too, is an orphan girl, Rebeca, who arrives mysteriously one day and whose origin is unclear. Nevertheless, the Buendías raise her as one of their own children, first conquering her self-destructive habits of eating dirt and whitewash. Rebeca,</style>

<h3>7 pt Minion</h3>
<style class="tremolo box minion-7" contenteditable>it soon becomes evident, is afflicted with an insomnia that also causes memory loss. Eventually, the entire town becomes infected with insomnia and the associated amnesia. To facilitate memory, the inhabitants of the town begin to label everything; First they put up a giant sign to remind themselves that god exists, and then dread the day when the labels will have no meaning because the residents will have forgotten how to read. Pilar Ternera, who tells fortunes on a deck of cards, now uses the cards to tell the past as well. The insomnia is only cured when, unexpectedly, Melquíades the gypsy returns to town bearing an antidote. Melquíades, who, it seems, has returned from the dead, brings with him a technology never before seen in Macondo, the daguerreotype; José Arcadio Buendía sets to work trying to make a daguerreotype of God, to prove His existence.</style>
